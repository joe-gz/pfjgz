Patricia, I love you more than I thought was possible, yet somehow it's even more every day.
Thank you so much for allowing me to be a part of your life. You are the most amazing and fascinating woman.
You have made me the happiest person on earth. I promise I will continue to do everything I can to make you happy for a lifetime if you'll have me.
You are the love of my life, and my best friend. I am yours forever.



This app is meant to be a sort of virtual scrap book, for what I can only hope will be a LIFETIME of adventures, romantic nights, fun activities, travels, and more.
I hope we can keep improving it together, with all of our memories, and everything to come.
I LOVE YOU! You have my heart, and you can keep it forever
